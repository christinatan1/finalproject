# Systems Final Project

**_Stephanie Liu and Christina Tan_**

Description of project: 
Our project mimics the game 20 Questions. There are two types of players: an answerer and questioner(s). The answerer thinks of an object from one of the following categories: Person, Place, or Thing, and the questioner has to guess the object. The questioner(s) can ask 20 questions to figure out the object. The answerer can only reply with “yes” or “no.” If after 20 questions, the questioner(s) has not guessed the object, the answerer wins. If the questioner does guess the object, the questioner(s) wins and the answer is revealed.

User interface:
The category is displayed after the answerer has decided on an object. Questioner(s) and answerer take turns asking questions and answering. The number of remaining questions is displayed for all players after each answer.

Jan 10 - Implement asking questions and answering and how data is stored.
Jan 13 - Networking between two (or more) players, start debugging.
Jan 17 - Submit final product
